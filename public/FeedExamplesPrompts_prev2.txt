This is a SOF (statement of facts) issued from vessel Jag Laxmi.
Every SOF should be signed & stamped (Mostly hand signature) by 3 parties.
1) The vessel/master
2) The Agent
3) The Terminal/Port
Could you please confirm the same is applicable for this attached SOF?

Next step is i want to filter out some of the documents.
We want to only keep the SOFs, the NORs and the LOPs for this checking
Ok next step. SOFs must have present 3 of the signatures.
Rest of the documents must have vessel's signature and one more at least. so if vessels +1 signature is present dont show X red mark
ok but dont show the X in the other docs besides the SOFs. i see agent X when vessel +1 from terminal is present
good. cut the rule compliance note. Also for SOF if an lop mentioning same is present pls mention it so it gets overwritten
next step. if an an nor tendered/retendered timing is mentioned in the SOF, it should also exists as a document with the same datetime mentioned
ok lets make this check and new section after all signatures are checked.
1) Signatures check for SOF/Timesheet, NOR(Tendered/Retendered), LOP(Letter of Protest)
2) Nors present as per vessels SOF timings. Checkmark green or red X mentioning the missmatch ####Vessel Docs.pdf####
